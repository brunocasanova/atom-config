  "readme": "#Twix [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/icambron/twix.js.png?branch=develop)](http://travis-ci.org/icambron/twix.js)#\n\nTwix is a simple but opinionated JS library for working with date ranges, and includes a customizable smart formatter. It's written in CoffeeScript and it depends on [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).\n\nIt allows you to do, among other things, this:\n\n```js\nvar t = moment(\"1982-01-25T09:30\").twix(\"1982-01-25T13:30\");\n\nt.format();  //=> Jan 25, 1982, 9:30 AM - 1:30 PM\n\nt.isSame(\"day\"); //=> true\nt.humanizeDuration(); //=> \"4 hours\"\nt.count(\"days\"); //=> 1\n```\n\nAnd much more.\n\n##[Documentation](http://icambron.github.io/twix.js/)\n\n##Building##\n\nIf you want to build Twix for yourself, you'll need to install CoffeeScript. Then clone the repo out and run this:\n\n    make configure build\n\nConfigure just installs the NPMs and brings in Moment as a submodule, so you only have to do that part once.\n\nNote that the source is `src/twix.coffee`; the output is `bin/twix.js`. You can run the tests via\n\n    make test\n\nYou can also run the tests in-browser by building and then loading `test/test.html`.\n\n##Contributing##\n\nPatches are welcome!\n\n * Submit pull requests to the `develop` branch. I merge develop to master when we cut a release.\n * Don't include your changes to the generated `.js` files in the patch; they're much harder to merge. I'll generate them when I cut the release.\n\n##Changelog##\n\n * **0.5.0**: Fix intersection/overlap behavior (#36), expand signature, and deal with Moment deprecations.\n\n * **0.4.0**: Simplified internationalization support (**possibly breaking change for those few people using French support**), added more complex iteration durations. Reverted build complexity.\n\n * **0.3.0**: AMD support, basic internationalization support, bug fix for `countInner` and `iterateInner`. Component and bower support. New build system and code organization.\n\n * **0.2.2**: Added `isValid` and `intersection`, fixed `overlaps` for adjacent times, renamed `merge` to `union`, added deprecation warnings.\n\n * **0.2.1**: Added `countInner`, `contains`, `iterateInner`, and `length`\n\n * **0.2.0**: Deprecated `sameDay`, `sameYear`, `countDays`, `daysIn`, `past`, and `duration`. Added `isSame`, `humanizeLength`, `asDuration`, `isPast`, `isFuture`, `isCurrent`. Added duration methods. Emphasized moment() monkey patch methods over Twix() constructor. Some bug fixes.\n\n * Older versions - wasn't tracking.\n\n##License (MIT)##\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Isaac Cambron\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
